    Linear combination method for evalation score is a felixable and good approxation
    function and suitable method for pacman game. 
    
    For the features; the score of the game, closest food distance, 
    closest capsule distance, closest edible and inedible ghost distance 
    are used. f1 gives a good average score for the game state and takes the time and 
    win/lose status of the game in to calculations. Altought it captures eating a food and 
    ghost points, its not enough for good evalation, therefore the distance to closest food 
    solves the case. The agent will want to decrease the min distance since its inverse 
    proportionally added to score therefore it will eat the food. Capsules have same 
    approach with food, additionally the weight is larger due to the importance of a capsule.
    Distance to inedible ghost has a small weight since the agent can come close to ghost unless 
    it won't reach to agent. In addition if the closest distance to the ghosts is 
    equal to zero which means same location feature score will 1000 for penalty purposes. 
    Edible ghost has same approch with food however their weight has higher absolute value 
    since eating a ghost is is better than eating food if the ghost is close. 

    For the weights, the importance of food and distance has thought, altought the precision 
    of the weights are experimental.
